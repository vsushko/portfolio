# Java/Scala Test

Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money transfers between accounts.

Explicit requirements:
1. keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is invoked by another internal system/service) 
1. use whatever frameworks/libraries you like (except Spring, sorry!) but don't forget about the requirement #1 
1. the datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test 
1. the final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a pre-installed container/server) 
1. demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected

Implicit requirements:
1. the code produced by you is expected to be of high quality. 
1. there are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
